# tic-tac-toe
This tic-tac-toe program allows for players, whether users or agents, to play against each other.  Each agent can be selected to implement a Random approach, Depth-First Search (DFS) approach, or an Alpha-Beta approach.  
The random algorithm programs an agent to choose its next move randomly.  With the DFS and alpha-beta algorithms, an agent creates a tree data structure where each node consists of a game board based on the possible moves left to be played in the game.  Both allow for an agent to traverse each branch of this tree starting from the root node (board containing next possible move) to a leaf node (board containing a win or draw) before traversing the next branch.  Each branch is evaluated based on its leaf node's value: 1 if X wins, -1 if O wins, and 0 if draw.  Each agent agent picks the move associated with the branch that yields the maximum -- or minimum -- value.  The difference between the DFS and Alpha-Beta agents is the number of branches that must be evaluated before making each move.  The former must go through every possible branch while the latter can "prune" certain branches that lead to an unwanted game-board result.  Thus the Alpha-Beta agent will run faster but will still always draw when placed against a DFS agent.
